# Gene-Expression-Data-Analysis

Analysis of transcriptomics data generated from technologies such as oligonucleotides or two-channel microarrays, qRT-PCR, and RNA sequencing. Techniques include scaling/normalization, outlier analysis, and missing value imputation. The aim was to identify differentially expressed genes and correlate their expression with clinical outcomes such as disease activity or survival. Also includes an introduction to linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods and both supervised and unsupervised clustering and classification approaches.
